## Getting Started

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/portainer-template.git
   cd portainer-template
   ```

2. **Create a Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

3. **Test Your Changes**
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   docker-compose up -d
   # Test your changes
   docker-compose down
   ```

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/` - for new features
- `fix/` - for bug fixes
- `docs/` - for documentation changes
- `refactor/` - for code refactoring
- `test/` - for adding/updating tests

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update Documentation**
   - Update README.md if you change functionality
   - Update QUICK_REFERENCE.md for new commands
   - Add comments to complex code

2. **Test Thoroughly**
   - Test on clean installation
   - Test with different configurations
   - Verify existing functionality still works

3. **Write Clear Commit Messages**
   ```
   feat: add support for PostgreSQL
   
   - Add PostgreSQL docker service
   - Update documentation
   - Add migration guide from MariaDB
   ```

4. **Keep PRs Focused**
   - One feature/fix per PR
   - Small, reviewable changes
   - Split large changes into multiple PRs

5. **Request Review**
   - Assign reviewers if you know who to ask
   - Be responsive to feedback
   - Make requested changes promptly

## Style Guidelines

### Shell Scripts

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#
# Script description
# Usage: ./script.sh [args]
#

# Use meaningful variable names
DATABASE_NAME="myapp"

# Add comments for complex logic
# Calculate backup retention period
RETENTION_DAYS=7

# Use functions for reusability
function backup_database() {
    local db_name=$1
    # Function logic here
}

# Error handling
if [ ! -f ".env" ]; then
    echo "Error: .env file not found"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Docker Compose

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  # Clear service names
  web:
    # Use specific versions
    image: nginx:1.21-alpine
    # Descriptive container names
    container_name: myapp-web
    # Always specify restart policy
    restart: unless-stopped
    # Group related configs
    environment:
      - KEY=value
    # Use named volumes
    volumes:
      - ./config:/etc/nginx
    # Explicit port mapping
    ports:
      - "8081:80"
```

### Documentation

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples
- Add screenshots for UI steps
- Keep formatting consistent
- Update table of contents
- Use proper Markdown syntax
